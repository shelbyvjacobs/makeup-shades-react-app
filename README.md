# makeup-shades-react-app

## Description & Features
This app utilizes React and the Makeup Shades API (available [here](https://github.com/shelbyvjacobs/makeup-shades-api)) to create an interactive user experience with full CRUD functionality. Users are able to not only view all of the makeup shades in the API, but also add their own, update existing shades, and delete unwanted shades.

The Makeup Shades API contains information about makeup foundation colors in the United States, Nigeria, India, and Japan. Each object contains information on the brand, the product name, the hexidecimal color code, HSL and HSV color codes, and the the country where it is most popular.

## Getting Started
This app is deployed [here](https://ecstatic-brown-3c06d8.netlify.com/).

Please visit the site and explore all of the makeup shades! The forms at the top of the Shades page (the main page) allow you to create, update, or delete shades. Simply enter the information prompted and click the submit button!

## Goals
* build an app using React
* Utilize Axios to access the API
* Incorporate CRUD functionality
* Write thorough documentation

In the future, I would like to improve upon this app by ...
* Including a search bar, so brands, products, countries, and hex codes can be easily searched.
* Improve navigation
